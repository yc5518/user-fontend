# `user-web`

This font-end project is inherited from angular-seed project. I made adjustment to the functionalities I need.

The interface provide functionalities of searching all user infomation, fuzzy search and searching single user info.

# Install Dependencies

I have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].
* In order to run the end-to-end tests, you will also need to have the
  [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] installed on your machine. Check out the section on
  [end-to-end testing](#e2e-testing) for more info.

I have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

# Run the Application

I have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`].


# Things to be done
1. Update user info function is not working properly on front-end.
2. Could have a more beautiful layout
